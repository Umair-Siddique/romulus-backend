      summary: Create organization profile
      description: |
        Creates a comprehensive organization profile for an existing user account.

        **Prerequisites:**
        - Valid JWT authentication token
        - Existing user account (referenced by user ID)
        - User must not have existing educator or organization profile

        **File Upload Support:**
        - Content-Type: multipart/form-data
        - Supported formats: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp (images), pdf (documents)
        - Files are processed and stored with generated paths
        - Dynamic file mapping for branch residence guidelines

        **Validation Rules:**
        - Founded year must be between 1900 and current year
        - SIRET number must be exactly 14 digits
        - At least one branch required
        - All text fields are trimmed and validated for length
        - Phone numbers must be in international format

        **Business Logic:**
        - Prevents duplicate organization profiles per user
        - Prevents organization profile if user has educator profile
        - Processes branch array with dynamic file mappings
        - Handles both file uploads and uses defaults for optional files
        - Maps residence guidelines files to branches using dynamic keys: `branches[index][residenceGuidelines]`
