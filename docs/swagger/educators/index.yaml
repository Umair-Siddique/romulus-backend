      summary: Create educator profile
      description: |
        Creates a comprehensive educator profile for an existing user account.

        **Prerequisites:**
        - Valid JWT authentication token
        - Existing user account (referenced by user ID)
        - User must not have existing educator or organization profile

        **File Upload Support:**
        - Content-Type: multipart/form-data
        - Supported formats: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp (images), pdf (documents)
        - Files are processed and stored with generated paths
        - Default URLs provided for optional document fields

        **Validation Rules:**
        - Age must be between 18-100 years (calculated from dateOfBirth)
        - At least one skill and one language required
        - All text fields are trimmed and validated for length
        - Skills normalized to lowercase
        - Hourly rate must be between 0-10000

        **Business Logic:**
        - Prevents duplicate educator profiles per user
        - Prevents educator profile if user has organization profile
        - Processes comma-separated strings into arrays for skills
        - Handles both file uploads and direct URL inputs
